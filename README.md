# Privacy-Preserving-Federated-Identity-Management


## Overview

This repository contains supplementary material to ou survey on **privacy-preserving federated identity management (IF)**. 
Federated identity systems enable users to access multiple service providers (SP) with credentials from one or more identity providers (IdP), raising privacy concerns. 
Our survey systematically organizes **privacy requirements** and **enhancement techniques** in this field, based on **Systematic Mapping Study (SMS)** and **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** methodologies.

## Objectives

- Understand privacy requirements for IF
- Identify enhancement techniques used
- Evaluate the alignment with existing IF standards
- Assess the enforcement of privacy requirements
- Draw conclusions on practical deployability and future research directions

## Methodology

Our survey follows the SMS and SLR methodologies to gather and analyze research from the past ten years. Key aspects include:
- Current Trends:
   - Nature of the research area,
   - Distribution by publication year, application domain, and contribution type
   - 
- Privacy Requirements and Techniques:
-   Privacy requirements and formalization degree
-   Techniques to enforce requirements
-   Assurance methods for enforcement
-   Alignment with existing standards
-   Preservation of fundamental authentication objectives


## Repository Content

- Our Survey Paper: Detailed findings on privacy-preserving IF.
- Supplementary Material: Figures, tables, raw search results, and detailed analyses for each paper.
